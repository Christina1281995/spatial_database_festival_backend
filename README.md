# A Spatial Database as the Backend for a Festival App

### To run this program

1. Create a database called 'festival' in postgres.
2. Download the three python files in '[src](https://github.com/Christina1281995/spatial_db_finalproject/tree/main/src)' (if required, install any python modules).
3. Run main.py (then your connection to the database and all tables and data will automatically be added and you will be guided through the queries).

### Context

The initial motivation for this project was the final project of a 'Spatial Databses' course at the University of Salzburg. The aim is to create a spatial database that can serve as the backend to a festival, specifically it should:
- Serve as database backend to organise the booths, roller coasters, tents etc.
(Positions, opening times, ...) as well as other facilities (garbage bins, toilets
etc)
- User-specific, dynamic queries that return which events take place or facilities
that are close to the current visitorâ€™s position.
- User-specific and dynamic queries about the festival (digital maps, lists of
events etc


### Psycopg2

To create dynamic queries into a spatial database, there must be some form of user interaction. At the outset of this project I had no previous experience with any other postgres interaction points other than PG admin and QGIS. Both of those are direct communication channels with the database, where SQL statements are directly entered. In order **to mediate, narrate, control and guide a user around the data that is in such a spatial database, there must be an additional step in between the database (or PG admin) and the user**. The user should not need to worry about the queries and data flow to and from the database. Likewise, there should be minimal risk of the user damaging the data or inserting erroneous data. For all of those reasons, I searched the internet for an adequate "in-between" tool, and found [psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/). It is the main database connector for the python language. By making use of it, I was able to work with both the user and the data. The finished programme consists of 3 python files: 
1. The "main.py" file which only contains the execution logic for the programme. It calls the relevant functions. 
2. The "functions.py" file contains all the functionalities needed to set up the database and execute the queries according to the user input. It also includes the function for a [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) pop-up window with a map showing some relevant spatial information of the query.
3. The "locations.py" file containing some spatial information in the format that tkinter requires it for the map (which is a very different format than the geom datatypes available with postgres). If the geometry could have been converted from the database tables' geom columns I would rather have done that, but I couldn't quite work out how to reformat it so much in an automated way.
All three code files are saved [here](https://github.com/Christina1281995/spatial_db_finalproject/tree/main/src) in the GitHub repository.

### Data Model

A first concept for the database was created through simple brainstorming on the topic of "what would be a good use for an app during a festival?" and "what would I use an app for at a festival?". Based on those notes, a few key entities were identified: tents, tent areas, stages, performers, events, food stalls, food areas. With those entities in mind a set of concrete questions was developed which queries into the database should answer. With those entities and the questions / plain-text queries in mind, a data model was sketched (see image below). This data model is intentionally kept simple. It is **only as complex as it needs to be for the intended queries. As such, it is "fit for purpose"**. The decisions for the cardinalities are, of course, debatable. They were determined by my own decision: e.g. that a performer only belongs to one stage and one event.

### Setting up the Database, the Tables, and the Data

The only set conducted in PG admin was to create a database with the name "festival". The remainder of the set up is implemented with psychopg2. A set of functions is executed to connect with the database, check for the existence of a PostGIS extension and the database tables. Then, both are added and the tables are filled with data taken from CSV files stored online in this GitHub repository. Since there are quite a few functions, a summarized list for reference is placed at the bottom of this README page. Please also refer to the functions.py file itself.


### User Interaction

Although not required, a central element for this project is the user interaction. In the following section I detail the logic of the available queries.
The tables below show the different interactions available to the user. Please note that the user's input is represented in the queries through the "%s" symbol. In later stages of this project, the SQL commands were re-written into preprared statements as plans. The queries shown here still display the structure of the queries.

As mentioned above, these queries are embedded in python script that performs the following:
- executes the queries as prepared statement plans to prevent SQL injection attacks
- Performs various validity checks on user input before sending the queries (e.g. for updates to the database the user input is checked for the correct format and whether the input is a within a valid range)
- Guides the user through the query process through descriptions.

**Here is an example of this python-SQL construct for task 5 ("Update number of staff at a stage"):**

First the SQL queries are prepared as part of the setup() function:

```
    # Task 5
    cur.execute("prepare plan5_1 as "
                "SELECT max_staff FROM stages WHERE id = $1;")
    cur.execute("prepare plan5_2 as "
                "UPDATE stages SET cur_staff = $1 WHERE id = $2;")
    cur.execute("prepare plan5_3 as "
                "SELECT stage_name FROM stages WHERE id = $1;")
```

Then, during the perform_tasks() function the user is guided through the process and several checks are performed. In this code snippet a few additional comments have been added to make the process more understandable.

```
    if task == "5" or task == "5.":
        # Task 5 -> Update the number of staff members at a stage.
        
        # 5.1.
        # Get information to show user
        cur.execute("SELECT id, stage_name, cur_staff, max_staff FROM stages ORDER BY id ASC;")
        stages = cur.fetchall()
        print("\nID | Stage Name | Current Staff | Maximum Staff")
        for row in stages:
            print(f"{str(row[0])} | {str(row[1])} | {str(row[2])} | {str(row[3])}")
            
        # Get user input on which stage they want to update
        stage = input("\nFor which stage do you want to update the staff? Please enter the id.")
        
        # Check that the stage ID is valid
        if int(stage) in range(1, 6):
        
            # Execute plan to get the allowed maximum staff for the selected stage
            cur.execute("execute plan5_1 (%s)" % stage)
            result = cur.fetchone()
            maximum_staff = int(result[0]) + 1
            
            # Get user input for new staff count
            staff = input("What is the new staff count? ")
            
            # Check validity of input against the maximum allowed
            if staff.isdigit():
                if int(staff) < maximum_staff:
                
                    # 5.2.
                    # Execute plan to update item in database
                    cur.execute("execute plan5_2 (%s, %s)" % (staff, stage))
                    con.commit()
                    
                    # 5.3.
                    # Execute plan to get stage name and staff for display in map
                    cur.execute("execute plan5_3 (%s);" % stage)
                    name = cur.fetchone()
                    
                    # Set arguments for display in map
                    args[str(name[0])] = f"{str(name[0])} staff: {str(staff)}"
                    show_a_map = True
                    
                else:
                    print("The value you entered is larger than the maximum. Please try again next time!")
                    
            else:
                print("The value you entered wasn't recognised as a digit. Please try again next time!")
```


### Additional Output: A Map

The tkinter map pop-up window is a very simple spatial visualisation of the query. Since this project isn't programmed in a Jupyter Notebook so there are limited options for displaying a map. Here are some examples:

An output of task 12 ("Find the closest stage"):
